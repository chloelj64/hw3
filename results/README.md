#### Q1: 
The best design has generally even spacing, no large gaps or overcrowded areas of stimuli, comparatively. Additionally, stimuli from the same condition are fairly grouped together. This would be the most efficient because it allows HRF to rise and fall and create more contrast (variance) between conditions. 
#### Q2: 
The spacing between events, as the axes show, increases, so it appears the overall task takes longer because we have now imposed intervals between trials onto the design. 
#### Q3:
 After adding a limit to the number of repetitions of the same stimulus type, the design shows less grouped clusters of the same color because now the design is limiting the presentation of consecutive stimuli from the same condition. 
#### Q4: 
Based on the best designs created, the most optimal designs look more like block designs, with stimuli of the same types grouped together but adding limits on the crowding or gaps between presentations allows for better variance, however limits the unpredictability. There seems to be a give and take between predictability and time and creating optimal designs. 
#### Q5: 
The design efficiency became less efficient for 100 block durations, but slightly more efficient for 50 second durations. Slight difference between A-B and A-C designs each time if I’m reading the output correctly. 
#### Q6: 
Since increasing the polort option decreases design efficiency, this means the design is becoming less sensitive to detecting differences between conditions, which makes me guess that less is being controlled for so the data is not being refined or filtered down enough, so the holes in the sieve are becoming larger, and therefore differences harder to detect, and a higher efficiency number. Though when I research, it mentions that the polort controls the polynomial which would change the curve-fitting, and I suppose the less mapped to the curve, the less efficient?  
#### Q7: 
The main advantage of of event-related designs is the randomization of stimuli, but with only two stimuli types the user experience of ‘randomization’ is not as dramatic, and so for two-stimuli types I would choose block design. 
#### Q8: 
Because block design is not as useful for determining the time course of response, all seven stimuli types would have to be presented for a long time and would result in a long task for the participant. Secondly, a random order with seven types would be harder to predict and the participant would experience more unpredictable stimuli types, so I would choose event-related design.
